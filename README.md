# Excel-Automation
Using Excel to Clean data, Derive new data from current data and to create charts to visually display the data 

I sourced a CSV dataset from Kaggle.com, containing Premier League statistics. The original file spanned from 1993 to 2022, but I identified missing data points between 1993 and 2000. To ensure data integrity and focus on a robust dataset, I performed data cleaning to remove all entries prior to 2010. This left me with a comprehensive 12-year period of data, which I then utilized for further analysis and automation.

This Program presents original data in a clean, color-coded, and easy-to-read format.
Analyzes yearly trends by calculating statistics like total goals per season, complete with insightful charts.
Generates new, valuable team-specific metrics, including home and away win rates, providing deeper insights not found in the original dataset.
This isn't just a script; it's a data analysis and business intelligence tool that turns raw data into actionable insights. A big shout-out to AI for introducing me to collections.defaultdict for efficient data grouping which then completed the third sheet for me.
